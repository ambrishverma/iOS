This is an iOS application for Tips calculator with Swift. 

Time spent: 4-5 hours in total

Completed user stories:

Required: Basic Tip calculator with preset tip-percentages options
Required: Provide Settings view controller for saving and loading persistent settings parameters. I have used default tip-percentage value for this.
Optional: Retain/Cache current amount and tip-calculation available in app for 10 mins even if user switches to a different app, and clear the values if user comes back after more than 10 mins.

Notes:

I have created and verified the UI for iPhone5 and iPhone5s where it works great.
